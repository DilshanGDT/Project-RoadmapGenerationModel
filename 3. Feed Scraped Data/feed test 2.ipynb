      "Alright, let's tackle this query about extracting features from the tour information provided. So, first things first, I need to understand exactly what each required field means and how to find that information in the given text.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with **park_names**: The title mentions \"Yala National Park Wildlife Safari/ Game Drive - by Ajith Safari.\" That clearly points to Yala being one of the national parks. Since there's only one mentioned here, my list should just have \"Yala National Park.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is **primary_wildlife_focus**. The description talks about exploring wildlife in Sri Lanka and mentions that they're the main safari operator. While it doesn't specify a single animal or wildlife type, I think \"Elephants\" could be considered as a primary focus since Yala is known for its elephant populations. But if I'm unsure, maybe defaulting to \"General Wildlife\" would be safer.\n",
      "\n",
      "For **safari_type_detail**, the tour involves Jeep Tours and Game Drives. The title says \"Safari/ Game Drive,\" so that's two aspects here. However, the description also mentions \"Jeep Tours.\" So perhaps combining these into a single field makes sense: maybe something like \"Game Drive Safari (Jeep)\" to capture both elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at **suitability**, the tour is described as exploring breathtaking wilderness and being with Ajith Safari Jeep Tours. It doesn't explicitly mention any specific suitability, but since it's a safari, general wildlife experiences are often family-friendly or suitable for photography tours. Without more details, I might need to choose \"Photography Tour\" or \"Family-Friendly,\" but perhaps sticking with the main one here could be tricky.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Duration_category**: The duration is given as 4–14 hours. According to the instructions, durations up to 5 hours are \"Half-Day,\" 5–10 hours are \"Full-Day,\" and more than that are \"Multi-Day.\" Since 14 hours exceeds the Full-Day range, this should be categorized as \"Multi-Day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Price_category**: The starting price is $18. Given that budget tours are under $50, this clearly falls into the \"Budget\" category.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for **key_attractions**, the text mentions exploring Yala's wilderness and being with Ajith Safari Jeep Tours. It doesn't list specific attractions or animals beyond elephants, so maybe just note these aspects without detailing them further.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, **flexibility_notes**: The description says they're weather-dependent as safari operators. That suggests flexibility based on weather conditions, which might be a point to include here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting this all together, I need to ensure each field is accurately reflected in the JSON object. Let me double-check:\n",
      "- park_names: Just Yala National Park.\n",
      "- primary_wildlife_focus: Since elephants are highlighted but not explicitly named, \"General Wildlife\" as default.\n",
      "- safari_type_detail: Combines Game Drive and Jeep Tours into one description.\n",
      "- suitability: Choosing between general or specific; here it's unclear, so maybe stick with the main focus mentioned.\n",
      "- duration_category: 14 hours qualifies for Multi-Day.\n",
      "- price_category: $18 is definitely Budget.\n",
      "- key_attractions: General mentions without specifics.\n",
      "- flexibility_notes: Yes, weather-dependent.\n",

      "Duration_category analysis: The duration given is 4-14 hours. Based on my understanding, anything from 5-10 hours would be a Full-Day safari.
